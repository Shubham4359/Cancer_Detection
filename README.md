# Cancer_Detection
For the above repo we have 3 main files
The Dataset on which we have worked is not uniform hence data augmentation is required for which we have dara_augmentation file run this file on those class whose pictures are less.
Once done with data augmentation next run the preprocessing file just check your use case and remove functions not required it contains all the neccesary functions discussed in thesis, it has some extra functions also given once done with both the files.
Run the united3.ipynb file which has the main code for running the model, model architeture is stored in that file.
